# Guessing Game #

# Project by Adam King #

An HTML/CSS/JS built guessing game. 
Enter the number you want to submit as your guess in the input box. 
The displayed results will direct you based on how far away you are from guessing the actual number and in what direction (+/-) - pretty straightforward.

Have fun!
